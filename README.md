3. Final_Project.ipynb
   -Analysis file (run on Jupyter lab)
5. SITE.csv
   -Mapping coordinates
7. wetland.dbf
8. wetland.shp
9. wetland.shx

### Dependencies:
python 3.12,
numpy 2.2.2,
matplotlib 3.10.0,
pandas 2.2.3,

### Running Analysis:
Ensure all the files are downloaded from the MS263_Final repository and the dependencies are the correct version before running the analysis. 
In addition, the analysis is meant to run on Jupyter lab/notebook with internet connection (for the satellite maps). Restart the kernell and run all the cells. 
Read the data frame and make sure the sites and parameters are the right heading. Adjust your code to view other sites and parameters within Elkhorn Slough.
